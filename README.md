# p5.js Particle System Demonstration

Welcome! This project, hosted by the APL Innovation Lab, showcases the capabilities of p5.js in crafting visually striking and dynamic particle effects. Our core sketch animates text particles with smooth color gradients, creating an immersive and captivating visual experience.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a fun demonstration of a particle system built with p5.js. It's an engaging way to explore the possibilities of web-based graphics and interactivity.

## Features
- **Interactive Particle System**: Implemented using p5.js for a lively and responsive experience.
- **Colorful Display**: Each particle transitions smoothly in color, adding depth and vibrance to the animation.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Particles react interactively, changing states (like scattering and returning) based on user input.
- **Customizable Text**: The particle formation can spell out any message, offering a personalized touch.
